👋 Hi, I’m Rupam Sengupta

👀 I’m interested in data analysis, exploring AI-driven analytics, and digging deep into understanding data better. I’ve been working on this for quite some time but recently started revisiting and refining my approach.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate AI into analytics for better insights and automation.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects, automation in analytics, and knowledge-sharing in the data community.

⚡ Fun fact: I speak SQL and Python more than my native language.
